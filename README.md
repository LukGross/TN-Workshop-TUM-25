# Readme
This repository is meant as supplementary Material for the Workshop on Tensor Network techniques for computational fluid dynamics on the 5th and 6th of march 2025 at the TU Munich.

## Repository Content

#### Notebooks
* [MPS_operations](notebooks/MPS_operations.ipynb) offers some implementations of basic operations on MPS.
* [2D_compression](notebooks/2D_compression.ipynb) gives an example of the compression capabilities that MPS offer, if the underlying data is suitably structured.
* [transport_eqs](notebooks/transport_eqs.ipynb) provides a simple numerical solution to the transport equations using MPS.

#### Other
* [utils](notebooks/utils/) contains utility functions.
* [examples](notebooks/utils/) contains intermediate results of a simulation of the temporally decaying jets. This data is used in the 2D compression demonstration.
